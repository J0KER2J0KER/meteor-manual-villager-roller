# Meteor Manual Villager Roller

Addon that helps you change villager profession until the desired trade is found.

## Versions

Go to [releases](https://github.com/J0KER2J0KER/meteor-manual-villager-roller/releases/latest) for the newest version.

For older Minecraft Versions, use [ViaFabricPlus](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabricPlus).

## Solving use-case

This Addon is a fork of [Meteor Villager Roller](https://github.com/maxsupermanhd/meteor-villager-roller). This Addon does not reset the Villager trades by itself.
It will just notify you when the wanted Enchantment is found.
Unlike the original Villager Roller, this Addon can not be detected by Anticheat Systems.

## How-to

1. Acquire villager (not nitwit)
2. Acquire *some* lecterns (32 will be good)
3. (Recommended, not required) Acquire axe, better quality - faster rolling
4. Reset the Villager like you normally would
7. Configure module to your needs and enable it
8. When right-clicking a Villager, the Addon will close the UI and analyse the trades automatically
